## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Drizzle ORM chosen over TypeORM/Prisma (research recommendation -- better perf, smaller bundle)
- [Roadmap]: SVG seat map isolated in Phase 3 (highest-risk feature gets dedicated focus)
- [Roadmap]: Payment isolated in Phase 4 (separate from seat map to avoid mixing two high-risk areas)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: SVG performance with 1000+ seats on mobile needs early profiling
- [Phase 4]: Toss Payments sandbox requires business registration + PG contract
- [Phase 3]: Socket.IO multi-instance with Redis adapter needs Cloud Run min-instances=2 testing
